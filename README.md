# Classification-of-agricultural-crops
 Hi! Thank you for exploring my work. This project, developed for a university assignment, uses exploratory data analysis and multinomial logistic regression in Python to classify crop types based on soil and climate variables. It includes the notebook, dataset, and a report with the workflow and conclusions in the README.md file.
